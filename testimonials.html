            <p><q>This trip has had a radical impact on my Christian walk.
              All the incredible aspects of the trip – experiencing other cultures, worshiping and praying
              with other nationalities in different languages, studying the history of what God has done,
              and seeing firsthand what God is doing today – have led me to a deeper love for Christ and
              His Word. If I were to sum up the trip in one word, it would be ‘vision’. The carefully crafted
              curriculum coupled with unforgettable locations has instilled in me a clear and powerful vision
              of what the Lord is doing on this earth. Remarkably, we can play a part in this vision; we can
              hasten His coming.</q></p>

            <p><q>There are three things in life (besides God) that really have the power to change you:
              the books you read, the places you go, and the people you meet. In the summer of 2016, We read
              a book about God’s move over the past 2000 years; we visited places where the Holy Spirit had
              taken millennial steps to recover His church; we met people, other Christians, strangers who
              within minutes became to us a home and family. In Europe I saw the Body of Christ: the product
              of 2,000 years of God’s work! Seeing this really changed me!</q></p>

            <p><q>This trip is legendary. Each new city brought with it new people, new experiences, and new
              perspective on the things which I took for granted every day. We studied the influential people
              that participated in the move of the Lord on the earth who often times were persecuted, thrown
              into prison, or put to death for what they knew was the truth. Coming from a stagnant,
              run-of-the-mill Christian faith, reading about these people and then actually being in the
              places where these people did the Lord’s work radically changed my Christian life. As a direct
              result of this trip I have grown deeper into the Lord than I thought possible and experienced
              him in ways I never have.</q></p>

            <p><q>This trip was an amazing experience. It changed my life! Growing into adulthood, I had
              always had a small desire to know what it’s like in different countries. At one point, while
              studying at UT, I even considered studying abroad. Going on this trip, my desire was not only
              fulfilled, but I also got a lot of awesome and unexpected experiences! With such a purposeful
              journey, our time in Europe was packed with adventure. We got to see grand castles in Germany,
              the highest viewpoints in both the Czech Republic and France, and some of the first-ever printed
              words in England. I will never forget the time spent with my brothers in Christ. To name only a
              few experiences that we shared as a group feels almost like an injustice! I hope many more
              students can learn and experience all that we gleaned from traveling to Europe.</q></p>

            <p><q>Our trip to Europe was the trip of a lifetime and had an incredible impact on my walk with
              Christ! I got to see what the Lord has been doing in the church the past 500 years by recovering
              her many lost truths. The stories of the many men used by the Lord really inspired and encouraged
              me to pursue the Lord and the truth no matter the cost. Being able to see all the places where
              these men lived, worked, and were martyred really made everything more real and gave us a sincere
              appreciation for their sacrifice. Anyone who is able to go on this trip absolutely must! It’ll
              change your life.</q></p>

            <p><q>This trip was legendary. Not only was I able to see what God is doing throughout the world,
              but now I am able to participate in fulfilling the desire of His heart. Through prayer I can join
              myself to what He is doing in Europe while in Texas. This has revolutionized my Christian walk because
              I realize God needs our cooperation and prayers to carry out His purpose on this earth today.</q></p>

            <p><q>I am the Christian I am today because of this Europe trip. I believe God opened my eyes to
              not only see what He has done throughout church history, but what He is still doing today! I was given
               the blessed opportunity on this trip to step my big toe into the Lord’s move today and I can testify
               from what I’ve seen and heard that Jesus Christ needs a group of believers who pay the price to bring
               Him back again!</q></p>

            <p><q>This trip changed my perspective on the true scope of the Lord’s move on Earth and as a result made
              an incredible impact on my Christian life. It is one thing to hear about the sacrifices that countless
              people have made in history in the name of the Lord, but when you sit where they sat and stand where they
              stood one cannot help but realize the cost of the understanding of the Word that we so often take for
              granted. I loved seeing how the Lord used certain people over the ages and the need the Lord still has
              for more like those. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone!</q></p>

            <p><q>I thought the trip was incredible, and it sent the tone for my Christian life going forward. As
              this was my first trip outside the United States, I didn’t know what to expect. Now I’m so glad I went!
              Meeting believers outside the United States and seeing places pertaining to church history really gave me
              an appreciation for the Body of Christ, and it was very enjoyable. I also felt like I grew closer to the
              people I went on the trip with. Overall, the trip was refreshing to my Christian life, and I would recommend
              it to anyone.</q></p>
